Since the 1940s, when the digital computer was developed, it’s been clear that computers could be programmed to complete extremely complex tasks. For example, they could discover proofs for mathematical theorems or play chess. In fact, computers or computer-controlled robots can perform tasks typical of humans. That’s where artificial intelligence comes into play.

Are you interested in how to build an AI? This article provides a basic understanding of artificial intelligence, its application, and the steps necessary for making an AI.

What Is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to carry out tasks that intelligent beings perform. AI represents a branch of computer science. Siri, Alexa, and similar smart assistants, as well as self-driving cars, conversational bots, and email spam filters, are examples of AI.

Mathematician Alan Turing’s paper, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” and the Turing Test express AI’s fundamental goal and vision. Turing wrote his paper on artificial intelligence, arguing that there isn’t any convincing argument that machines can’t think intelligently like humans. Similarly, the Turing Test is a method of determining whether a machine can “think.”

Based on the information theory, intelligence is one’s ability to accept or transfer information and keep it in the form of knowledge. The information theory mathematically represents the conditions and parameters that affect how information is transmitted and processed

According to Shane Legg, co-founder of DeepMind Technologies, intelligence is the agent’s ability to set goals and solve different problems in a changing environment. If the agent is a human, you deal with natural intelligence, and if the agent is a machine, you deal with artificial intelligence.

AI Operation and Application
Increasingly, building AI systems is becoming less complex and cheaper. The principle behind making a good AI is collecting relevant data to train the AI model. AI models are programs or algorithms that enable the AI to recognize specific patterns in large datasets.

The better you make AI technology, the more wisely it can analyze vast amounts of data to learn how to perform a particular task.

The process of analyzing data and performing tasks is called machine learning (ML). For example, Natural language processing (NLP) gives machines the ability to read, understand human languages, and mimic that behavior. The most promising AI apps rely on ML and deep learning. The latter operates based on neural networks built similarly to those in the human brain.

Real-world applications of AI systems are wide-ranging. Below, you can find the most common examples of AI in daily life:

Speech Recognition
Also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is a capability that uses NLP to process human speech into a written format. For example, Siri utilizes speech recognition to conduct voice searches.

Customer Service
Increasingly, more companies are turning to online virtual agents for customer service, thus replacing human agents. According to Servion Global Solutions, 95% of all customer interactions will involve artificial intelligence by 2025.

Computer Vision
In this case, AI technology allows computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. You can see its application in photo tagging on social media.

Discovery of Data Trends
AI algorithms can use consumers’ behavior to discover data trends, allowing companies to build effective cross-selling strategies. As a result, companies can offer relevant add-on recommendations during the checkout process. That’s where predictive analytics software steps in.

Such software allows real-time decision-making with your data. For instance, the software can generate risk assessment models, such as fraud and risk detection, targeted advertising, and product recommendations.

Fraud Prevention
One of the primary problems that artificial intelligence tackles are payment and sensitive information fraud. Companies utilize AI-based systems to detect and prevent this type of fraud effectively.

Automated Stock Trading
AI-based high-frequency trading platforms make thousands or, sometimes, millions of trades each day. As of 2020, half of stock market trades in America were automated. According to Allied Market Research, the global algorithmic market size is forecast to account for $31.2 million by 2028.
